       <p class="p3">Policing systems were founded on the preservation of slavery, and the earliest and most prolific forms of policing were slave patrols-- established in 1700. Organized policing was one of the many social controls imposed on enslaved African Americans in the South. Slave Patrols were used to chase down, apprehend and return runaway slaves to their owners, which provided a form of organized terror to deter slave revolts and maintain a state of discipline for slave workers subject to swift justice. Slave patrols were legally obligated by local authorities to control Black people. They were allowed to whip, intentionally break up families, deprive basic human rights, and capture runaway enslaved people. Slave patrols "ended" during the civil war. However, many aspects carried over: Systematic surveillance, which has resulted in the death of many Black people nationwide, the enforcement of curfews, and notions of who could become a police officer.

            The police have terrorized Black communities for generations and have continued to get away with it. The BLM movement was born out of violence. The list of Black and Brown people that police have murdered is longer than many of us would like to acknowledge. Out of all the victims of police terror, only a handful make headlines or become active martyrs in our struggle. Slogans such as "I can't breathe" or "Hands up, don't shoot" serve as reminders of the violence we endure. Police violence is a leading cause of death for young men in the United States. Over the life course, about 1 in every 1,000 Black men can expect to be killed by police. The fundamentals of the police were to be this entity that protected the white class." Policing in America cannot be reformed because it is designed for violence." The oppression is a feature, not a bug. The enemy to a white person has always been their Black counterpart. The police over police predominantly Black neighborhoods Black women and men and American Indian and Alaska Native women and men are significantly more likely than white women and men to be killed by police. The police were never meant to protect us.

            As police murders continue and superficial reforms prove unable to stop them, more and more people are recognizing that the problem is not within police institutions–it is the institution of policing itself. The only way to end police violence is to transform society and make wealth and resources freely available to all. Far from reforming the policing while maintaining their current role, this aim requires abolishing the police altogether. I envision a cop-free world, where  Instead of relying on the police to resolve our conflicts, the community turns to each other. When we call the police for help in Black communities, we run the risk of police harming the person in danger. Police arms are used every day to injure and kill poor people and people of color and are further employed to repress protests and resistance, which is the reason why: imagine a world where the police aren't a force that solely protects white people. 
            I imagine a future where the police yield as much power as they do now.I imagine a future where people aren't subject to illegal searches and arrest.

        <ul class="p5">
          <li> I imagine a future where repressive policy policies at local, state, and federal levels, like Stop-and-Frisk in New York City or Civil Gang Injunctions in Houston, don't exist.</li>
          <li>I imagine a future where police stations and other facilities are turned into community centers, where children can come after school and take part in activities reserved for the upper class. </li>
          <li>I imagine a future where police and metal detectors that serve to criminalize young students  are not in any schools</li>
          <li>  I imagine a future where police is not a job anyone applies but rather an entity of the past </li>
          <li>  I imagine a future where we police no longer carry lethal weaponry </li>
          <li>I imagine a future where "crime" talk doesn't dehumanize Black, indigenous, NBPOC, poor, queer, unruly, and rebellious people, where the norm isn’t to villify BIPOC in the media . </li>
          <li>  I imagine a future where police unions don’t have as much power, including lessening their influence in local governments and ultimately decertifying and disbanding their unions entirely.</li>
          <li>I imagine a future where people have disbanded the police forces entirely</li> 
          <li> I imagine where the institution of race and policing no longer works to stunt the growth of Black people</li>
