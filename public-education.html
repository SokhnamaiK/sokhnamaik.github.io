        <p class="container4PBPA">In Brown v.s the board of education, a father, Oliver Brown, sued the Board of Education-Topeka, Kansas after his daughter was denied entry into an all-white school. The supreme court ruled that separating children in public schools on the basis of race was unconstitutional and ended the legalization of school segregation. This monumental case was the beginning of the era in the school district. However, even with the law passed, many policies have been in place in order to continue the segregation of schools under the law, such as redlining. Redlining was the practice of  refusing to give funding to certain neighborhoods, usually Black communities.
            The cause and effects of redlining greatly affect the present-day public school system. Because African Americans were pushed to poorer underdeveloped neighborhoods and were unable to get loans, the value of education and neighborhood went significantly down. No one was building nice grocery stores or beautiful buildings in those neighborhoods because no one invested in those neighborhoods. There was more business in white communities because those weren't redlined. Moreover School policy forced children to go to school where their neighborhood was. Less funding made for inedquate building and education. There was just no money for it due to the property value being low. Affulent neighborhoods were where the good schools were and it wasn't a coincidence that those were where white families were located as well. This history of redlining has contributed to the segregation of schools today.

        <p class="container4PBPR"> [CURRENT BUDGET: 17 Billion] Education classifies as a human right based on the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution In. This amendment states, "No state shall deny to any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection clause" (est 1868). However, numerous legislative policies, including school district zoning, contribute to inequality actions toward BIPOc students. Currently, 45% of local taxes, a portion of that percentage is through property taxes, contribute to the public education fund for each state; In higher and wealthier neighborhoods, the property taxes are drastically higher, which increases the funds of that specific school district. 
            Furthermore, mandated standardized testing contributes to inequality. Without the proper funding and educational support, BiPOC students are more likely to test poorly on their exams. Schools that have a higher budget can afford to hire more teachers, smaller classrooms to cater better to students' needs, more licensed social workers and counselors in the schools, updated equipment and resources for the students, and a higher income incentive for educators. Teachers just don’t care because the government is not paying them for the future and teaching these students. Or rather some do but do not have the resources to support their students.
            Moreover, school suspensions and expulsions are higher in schools that largely consist of students of color. "BIPOC students lost 103 days per 100 students enrolled. Eighty-two more days than the 21 days their peers lost due to out-of-school suspensions". The presence of school police and metal detectors introduces BIPOC students to the school-to-prison pipeline.

                More school funding would allow for significant additional resources for low-income students. It costs more to educate low-income students and provide them with a robust education. To overcome issues of poverty, low-income students need significant additional funds. Research shows that increases in school spending result in greater educational and economic outcomes for all students, but these were “more pronounced for children from low-income families.”Additional funding would help to attract highly qualified teachers, improve curriculum, and fund additional programs such as early childhood education, which is why: 
                ☼I imagine a future where dropping out of highschool isn't commonplace for the Black community.
                ☼I imagine a future where affirmative action isn't critized by the general public
                ☼I imagine a world where Black children's growth isn't stunted by the various institutions put in place.
                ☼I imagine a future where Black students get into elite schools without the added struggle of not having the opportunities given to white students.
                ☼I imagine a future where Black students have access to any extracurricular they are interested in.
                ☼I imagine a future where Black students are awarded fair and good education like their white counterparts. 
                ☼I imagine a future where Black children aren’t arrested for throwing a tantrum-behaivor exhibited across all races.
