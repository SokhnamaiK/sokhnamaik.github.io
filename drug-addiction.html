        <p class="bambi">An unfair system arrested millions of Black people yet urged compassion for white people during the crack epidemic. The"Crack epidemic" lasted from 1984-1990, however we still see the consequences of how we handled the epidemic today. Cocaine, previously a rich person's drug was crystallized by drug dealers in order to turn more of a profit. This new version of cocaine made it possible for the lower class to use it, which was predominately the Black community. Drugs dealers turned so much profit from Black peoples struggles, and that led to an increase in violence since they were killing their competition. In 1985, the number of people who admitted to using cocaine on a routine basis increased from 4.2 million to 5.8 million. By 1987, crack was reported to be available in all but four states in the United States. When it comes to the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic, the priority is saving lives. In contrast, the remedy for crack was mass arrests and stiff prison sentences in Black communities.
            After they could ignore it no more Nancy Reagan promoted an anti-drug campaign, However, The Reagan administration's "say no to drugs'' campaign was a slap in the face for Black communities since the government and police force weren't working at all to help people suffering from addiction.  The U.S. government had turned a blind eye to the importation of cocaine, and let poorer communities surfer
            Most Cops patrolling these Black communities didn't want to get involved, and other cops were corrupt. The corrupt cops  would shake down drug dealers and deal them themselves.

            A racial double standard has been hard-wired into the nation's drug laws and criminal justice system since the heyday of the crack epidemic. They would not offer treatment but rather just lock the Black addicts up, while they nurtured the white addicts back to health. For example, Richie Lapinski, a white male, developed a substance abuse problem, and instead of jail time, he got addiction treatment paid but taxpayers, and his record was wiped clean.This would never happen to his Black counterpart. Opioids have changed the way America looks at drug users, but it hasn't changed the fact that Blacks are punished more severely than whites for drug crimes, even though drug use within the two racial groups is roughly the same. The Black arrest rate has been and remains out of proportion to Black Americans' share of the U.S. population.
            Black people in 21 states were arrested at a rate at least three times higher than whites for narcotics and cocaine offenses combined in 2016. Blacks were more than 11 times as likely as whites to be arrested for cocaine or narcotics offenses. The racial gap in drug enforcement and sentencing is a byproduct of America's punitive response to the crack crisis of the late '80s and the war on drugs it unleashed. The signature law of that era was the federal Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which singled out crack offenders for the most severe punishment.

<p class="baekhyun"> BUDGET: 347 Billion
    “Our discomfort with the idea of heroin available at drug stores is similar to that of a Prohibitionist shuddering at the thought of bourbon available at the corner store. We'll get over it— because we should, and we must. “
    Addiction is a disease that has plagued america for generations, and has continued to punish the Black community. Unfortunately addiction is not going away anytime should, so I believe we should make it safe to consume them, They should be available in maintenance doses, possibly for free. Making it safer to consume drugs means fewer deaths and overdoses. Resources now tied up in useless enforcement would be used for truly effective rehabilitation programs. The elimination of the War on Drugs Would entail completing the other half of the rescue of Black America that welfare reform contributed in 1996, which is why:
    I imagine a future where there is Drug rehabilitation instead of prison. 
    I imagine a future where Nonviolent drug offenders will not be sent to jail; instead, they will have opportunities for rehabilitation. 
    I imagine a future where marijuana is legalized everywhere, and reducing the length of sentences for possession of crack cocaine is reduced significantly. 
    I imagine a future where hard drugs are available for purchase for prices below anything that could make a living for someone selling them on the street.
