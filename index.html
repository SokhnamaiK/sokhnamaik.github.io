                <p class="p1">My website examines how the lives of Black people in America would improve if we redirected police funding to improving the historical struggles faced in our communities. I chose to focus on public education, drug addiction, and mental health. Most people believe that the Black struggle is something of the past, so I decided to format my website in a past, present, and future structure to show that the past still affects our present. It is a look into the past that examines and analyzes important events that affected Black people. Then we move on to the present, which depicts the continued effects of those historical events. Finally, the future is my creative take on what the future would look like with police funding used elsewhere. I believe today's positive changes will make for a brighter Black future.

                <p class="p2"> The first quarantine period was an eye-opening experience. For the first time, I had a lot of time to be alone with my thoughts. It was a time for me to really understand my own Blackness and how it shaped who I am and the world around me. When the school first closed, we weren't sure when we would go back and that uncertainty coupled with a raging pandemic made for a very stressful time. Headlines were also flipping back and forth between a rise in covid cases and a slew of police brutality cases. Seeing that on the media became very numbing, which made the first quarantine feel like the world was flying past me while I was confined to my bedroom walls. Stuck with teachers and students that were thrown into online school-- time didn't feel real. In no time, May 25th rolled around. The day George Floyd died. The video of his death first surfaced on my Instagram feed; however, since it was so common for me to see Black deaths on the media, I made it a point to avoid the brutal images and videos online. However, George Floyd's video was everywhere, and it was one I could not escape nor tune out. The anger of Black people felt like no other, with numerous anti-police posts trending on the internet.

                <p class="p22">  
                I finally watched the video, and it left me with a horrible feeling in my stomach like someone had just put my intestines in a blender. I shut it off before George Floyd took his last breath. What I saw was a police officer kneeling with his whole weight on George Floyd's neck. It was as clear as day that this cop murdered this man that was already in cuffs and rendered defenseless. What really angered me was that there was debate whether this was murder or not when there was explicit evidence on what went down. I was livid to think that some people thought Officer Chauvin's actions were justified. The media began to vilify George Floyd and try and explain why the police were there in the first place. Even if there were a reason for an arrest, there was no reason for someone's death. I was only 7 when the death of Trayvon Martin took the nation by storm. After years and years of no change I had come to terms with no matter how exceptional us Black people are the world will never think so, and that was a fact that stung, What was even more frustrating was that I was able to come to this conclusion, but many of my peers hadn't. I couldn't articulate why I felt the way I was feeling and why I felt the world was pitted against me even though I had a strong support system. I believe that is the reason I could develop my love and passion for history at school. It gave me the facts that supported my present-day thoughts and feelings.

                <p class="p22">  
                Taking U.S. history at Calhoun felt very validating. For me, U.S. History was the first class that explained why the world is the way it is. Tying historical events to the present systems have helped me find inner peace on why I am treated and regarded differently because of my skin tone. It all just makes sense when a white kid doesn't understand that the phrase "I'm not racist" isn't good enough and when people don't want to put in the work to unlearn their anti-Blackness. There's a history explaining it all, and without it, I think I would go insane. However, that inner peace hasn't made me feel okay with the treatment I and other BIPOC receive. I want to do whatever I can to challenge people's biases, and through history, I learn what didn't work in the past. We are part of a new generation of activists and use innovative ways to combat today's racism.

                <p class="p22"> 
                U.S. History gave me the tools to understand my own identity and realize what I want to change in the world, such as the systematic racism that affects the lives of Black people across the nation. My project centers on how the past has so much bearing and effects on our present day. It is not a project that discusses life without police but rather a study on if we were to take some of the funding allocated to the police force how it would help mitigate the historical Black struggles in our nation. With my project, I take it one step further and try to imagine what we can do now to have a future where Black people feel seen and heard. With this website, you will travel back in time and slowly move to the present-day circumstances and then into the future of a world I have imagined. One that benefits and appreciates Black people. With a sprinkle of Black magic and Afrofuturism to construct this society, anything is possible. I got into the past to show the users that this history affects us today and that the change we make now will greatly benefit us and generations down the line. I hope you can take the time to read through my website and also imagine your own beautiful Black future.
